Using the traffic data and car movement records the data is visualized and the 
roads are visualized as graph.

Also when a new node is added to this graph the change in traffic accross all nodes 
is visualized and it is assumed that vehicles always take the shortest path from source
to destination.

Also peak traffic hours and nodes are identified in both cases.
